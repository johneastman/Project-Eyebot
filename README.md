# Project Eyebot
Project Eyebot is an artificial agent that plays [Fallout: New Vegas](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout:_New_Vegas).

# Object Detection
The first thing you will have to do is label the objects in your images. For this process, there is an excellent tool called [LabelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg), which generates XML files that are used by tensorflow to train the model.
